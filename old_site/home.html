    <h2>What I do</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm a student at Royal Holloway University studying Computer Science. The languages that I'm most comfortable with are Python and Java but I also have some experience programming in C.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time, I enjoy playing videogames, reading books or comics, and programming. Programming projects that I'm currently working on include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/DarthEmpty/Current" target="_blank">Current</a> - a tool allowing users on different machines to watch one set of local video files in sync
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/arranf/shadows-of-the-past-tracker" target="_blank">shadows-of-the-past-tracker</a> - a tool allowing users that play the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles board game to keep track of their campaign
      </li>
      <li>
        This website, of course!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I've done</h2>
    <p>
      In the summer after my first year, I took part in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities (UROP) programme where I worked alongside a Postgraduate student to investigate into Android SSL Insecurities.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my second year, I went to a Christian hackathon: Code for the Kingdom. This was a weekend long hackathon run by a company called Kingdom Code. I was part of a 4 person team which created <a href="https://github.com/richstandbrook/prayertree" target="_blank">PrayerTree</a> - an app dedicated to helping members of a church share their prayers with each other
    </p>

    <h2>What I want to do</h2>
    <p>
      Eventually, I would like to have a career researching Artificial Intelligence. I aim to discover or create something that can help and is used by most people one day and I believe that Artificial Intelligence research is a way in which I can achieve that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a couple of ideas for stories that, after some serious development, could be adapted into a book, a game or some other medium that I'd love to be apart of. So, it would be great to be apart of the development process
