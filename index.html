    <h1>Hey there!</h1>
    
    <p>
      I'm Joel Clarke and I'm an Artificial Intelligence PhD student at Royal Holloway University.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is a continuous project for me to work on, primarily dedicated to telling you about myself and to being a place for me to rant about (hopefully) interesting things.
    </p>

      During my time at Uni, I was fortunate enough to take part in the <strong>Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (UROP)</strong> twice.
      In my first year, I worked alongside a postgraduate student to investigate vulnerabilities in Android SSL Security.
      In my second year, I worked with a different postgraduate student and another second year student using Machine Learning to "unstrip" stripped binaries.

      During my second and third years, I took part in a Christian hackathon: <strong>Code for the Kingdom</strong>.
      This is an annual, weekend long hackathon run by a company called Kingdom Code.
      At the event, I've worked on:
      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/richstandbrook/prayertree" target="_blank">PrayerTree</a> - an app dedicated to helping members of a church share their prayers with each other.</li>
      <li><a hred="https://github.com/pixafera/geobudget" target="_blank">GeoBudget</a> - a budgeting app designed to remind people of their budget when they're nearby places where they spend money.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In my spare time, I enjoy drawing, playing video games and working on projects such as this website.
      Sooner or later, you'll see some of my drawings here - I'm hoping to start making a comic in the near future so watch out for that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Enjoy your stay :)
