        <h1>Hey there!</h1>
        
        <p class="intro">
          I'm Joel Clarke and I'm an Artificial Intelligence PhD student at Royal Holloway University.
        </p>

        <p>
          This site is a continuous project for me to work on, primarily dedicated to telling you about myself and to being a place for me to rant about (hopefully) interesting things.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my time at Uni, I was fortunate enough to take part in the <strong>Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (UROP)</strong> twice.
          In my first year, I worked alongside a postgraduate student to investigate vulnerabilities in Android SSL Security.
          In my second year, I worked with a different postgraduate student and another second year student using Machine Learning to "unstrip" stripped binaries. 
        </p>

        <p>
          During my second and third years, I took part in a Christian hackathon: <strong>Code for the Kingdom</strong>.
          This is an annual, weekend long hackathon run by a company called Kingdom Code.
          At the event, I've worked on:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/richstandbrook/prayertree" target="_blank">PrayerTree</a> - an app dedicated to helping members of a church share their prayers with each other.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/pixafera/geobudget" target="_blank">GeoBudget</a> - a budgeting app designed to remind people of their budget when they're nearby places where they spend money.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy drawing, playing video games and working on projects such as:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/arranf/jonathans-movies-client" target="_blank">jonathansmovies.com</a> - a voting web app using Vue and FeathersJS for a smooth, interactive experience</li>
            <li>This website! </li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          Sooner or later, you'll see some of my drawings here too - I'm hoping to start making a comic in the near future so watch out for that.
        </p>

        <p class="outro">
          <em>Enjoy your stay :)</em>
