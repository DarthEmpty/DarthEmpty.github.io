    During my time at Uni, I was fortunate enough to take part in the <strong>Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (UROP)</strong> twice.
    In my first year, I worked alongside a postgraduate student to investigate vulnerabilities in Android SSL Security.
    In my second year, I worked with a different postgraduate student and another second year student using Machine Learning to "unstrip" stripped binaries.
