A while ago, a friend of mine bought [Google Wifi] and started using it as the main Wifi router in his house. Both of us being major Google fans, we were very excited about seeing and using such cutting edge technology.

My laptop, on the other hand, was not...

I have a Dell Precision M4700 named *DMO* (Inspired by *BMO* from the cartoon *Adventure Time*). It's a chunky workstation that's designed to be easily moddable. I love it to bits but we've come across our fair share of troubles - which is probably bound to happen when you buy an outdated, second hand laptop off of eBay.

DMO's interactions with Google Wifi brought another issue to light. It seemed that, after connecting to the router, everything would work well up until a few moments later when the connection would just drop out. The connection wouldn't be restored until I actively disabled and re-enabled Wifi from the laptop which lead to the connection dropping out again, and so on. This would happen annoyingly often when playing the PC game: *Heroes of the Storm* - a game that's very reliant on a stable internet connection. There were incidents where I was penalised for disconnecting from the game because of DMO's petty disagreements with Google Wifi.

Eventually, enough was enough. After a little digging, my friend discovered that the wifi card itself was the issue. This was confirmed after I then researched the different types of Wifi card.
