So, it's finally here! My website - complete with blog and gallery - has finally managed to reach a decent standard and find a spot for itself on the internet.

:tada: **Yay!** :tada:

This is kinda big for me mainly because this is the first time I've done something like this. Turns out, I tend to focus on academic work when it calls - which is basically why this hasn't been done earlier than now. I did attempt to make a personal website around a year ago but, for some reason or another, I didn't manage to make very much of it during the Summer before my 3rd year at Uni started. Long story short, the site ended up taking a backseat. Once 3rd year was over and done with, however, I had *loads* of time to just sit back and work solidly on it.

*And it was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.*

Honestly, It's probably never been easier to set up a secure static blog. Now that [GitHub Pages supports HTTPS for custom domains](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/), it's relatively simple to:

1. Set up a GitHub repo to host your site for free
2. Create said site
3. Buy a domain and use it as an alias for said site
4. Attain a free SSL Certificate for said site

What's hard, however, is finding instructions on how to do all of this (probably because doing all of this wasn't possible until just over a month ago). I found this quite frustrating, thus this blog post was born.

Hopefully, by the end of this, you'll have a website that works like mine. It might be better looking than mine and it might be more useful than mine but it'll be on the internet, under your preferred domain name, encrypted on the wire for nothing but the price of your domain name.

## Hosting the Site Using GitHub Pages

## Creating a Site
Your site can be created any which way you want. As long as it's static, GitHub Pages will be able to host it with no issues.

I do, however, highly recommend that you use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a really simple static site generator, when doing so. I can testify to it being a very easy way to create web pages using Markdown and to maintain a blog with little hassle.

If you do decide to use Jekyll and you're new to it, I would give [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/) a go - it walks you through how to generate a static site, how to make your own custom theme, and more. I found it very helpful when creating this site, in fact!
