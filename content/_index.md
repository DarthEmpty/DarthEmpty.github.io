title: Hey There!

This site is a continuous project for me to work on, primarily dedicated to telling you about myself and to being a place for me to rant about (hopefully) interesting things.

During my time at Uni, I was fortunate enough to take part in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (UROP) twice.
In my first year, I worked alongside a postgraduate student to investigate vulnerabilities in Android SSL Security.
In my second year, I worked with a different postgraduate student and another second year student using Machine Learning to "unstrip" stripped binaries.

During my second and third years, I took part in a Christian hackathon: Code for the Kingdom.
This is an annual, weekend long hackathon run by a company called Kingdom Code.
At the event, I've worked on:

- PrayerTree
An app dedicated to helping members of a church share their prayers with each other.

- GeoBudget
A budgeting app designed to remind people of their budget when they're nearby places where they spend money.

In my spare time, I enjoy drawing, playing video games and working on projects such as:

- jonathansmovies.com
A voting web app that uses Vue and FeathersJS for a smooth interactive experience.

- Moment
A simulation web app that uses Vue to model A-Level Mechanics scenarios.

- Kilo
A Flutter app designed to help you keep track of your gym sessions.

- Stammered Voice
A web app made with Vue and FeathersJS to collect volunteered recordings of people with stutters.
Inspired by Mozilla's Common Voice

And, of course, this website!

Enjoy your stay :)
